        "Bionic Reading is a new method facilitating the reading process by
        guiding the eyes through text with artificial fixation points. As a
        result, the reader is only focusing on the highlighted initial letters
        and lets the brain center complete the word. In a digital world
        dominated by shallow forms of reading, Bionic Reading aims to encourage
        a more in-depth reading and understanding of written content."
